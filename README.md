## Semi-persistent arrays

Implemented by Jason Hemann and Dan Friedman.

Based on a design by Sylvain Conchon and Jean-Christophe Filli√¢tre.

See _A Persistent Union-Find Data Structure_. In ACM SIGPLAN Workshop
on ML, pages 37-45, Freiburg, Germany, October 2007.

This implementation extends the paper by allowing the array to be
expanded.
